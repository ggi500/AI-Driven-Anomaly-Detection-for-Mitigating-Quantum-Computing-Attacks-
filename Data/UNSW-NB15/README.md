# UNSW-NB15 Dataset

This directory contains the UNSW-NB15 dataset files.

To download the dataset, run the 'download_dataset.py' script in the project root:

```
python download_dataset.py
```

This script uses the Kaggle API to download the dataset files directly from Kaggle.

Note: The dataset files are large and are not tracked by Git. They will need to be downloaded separately by each user of this project.
