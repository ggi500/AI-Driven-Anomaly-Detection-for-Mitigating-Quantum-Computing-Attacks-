# AI-Driven-Anomaly-Detection-for-Mitigating-Quantum-Computing-Attacks-
Quantum-Resistant SWIFT Anomaly Detection
Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI-driven anomaly detection system for quantum-resistant cryptography in SWIFT networks. It aims to enhance the security of financial transactions in the post-quantum era by leveraging machine learning techniques and integrating CRYSTALS-Kyber implementations.
Features

Data preprocessing for SWIFT-like transactions
Integration of CRYSTALS-Kyber elements
Adaptation of pre-trained Isolation Forest and LSTM models
Anomaly detection in quantum-resistant cryptographic scenarios
